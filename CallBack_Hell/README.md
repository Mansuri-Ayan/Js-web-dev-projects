# Callback Hell Examples in JavaScript

This repository contains two examples demonstrating **callback hell** in JavaScript. Callback hell refers to a situation where multiple callbacks are nested within each other, leading to complex, hard-to-read, and hard-to-maintain code. The examples provided here simulate real-world scenarios, such as color changes in the DOM and saving data to a database.

## Examples

### 1. Color Change with Callback Hell

In this example, we simulate changing the color of an `<h1>` element in a sequence using nested callbacks. Each callback initiates the next color change, creating a deeply nested structure.

#### File: `example1.html`

This file demonstrates callback hell by nesting multiple color change operations one after another. Each color change is triggered with a delay, and subsequent changes are nested in the callback of the previous one. This structure creates callback hell, which is difficult to read and manage.

### 2. Database Save Simulation with Callback Hell

In this example, we simulate saving data to a database using callbacks. If the "internet speed" is fast enough, the data is saved successfully; otherwise, it fails. Each save operation is nested within the previous one, leading to a callback hell structure.

#### File: `example2.html`

This file demonstrates the use of callbacks in a database simulation. The operation is nested inside itself, and the result (success or failure) is determined by a random "internet speed". Each nested callback leads to the next save operation, creating a complicated, hard-to-read structure.
