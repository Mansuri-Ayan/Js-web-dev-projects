**ðŸŒŸ Just completed a new project: Tic Tac Toe with JavaScript!**
I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Working on this project has been a fun way to strengthen my JavaScript skills and dive into some game logic.

### Project Highlights:

- **Interactive UI:** Players can click to make moves, and the game recognizes winning combinations.
- **Dynamic Game Logic:** The game updates in real-time, preventing invalid moves and announcing a winner or draw.
- **Reset Functionality:** Players can start a new game with a single click.

You can check out the code here:

```

Building this game helped me improve my problem-solving skills and understand DOM manipulation better. ðŸŽ‰
Iâ€™m excited to continue building more projects as I dive deeper into the MERN stack!
